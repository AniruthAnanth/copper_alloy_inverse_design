# Inverse Design of Copper Alloys

This project explores the inverse design of copper alloys using machine learning models to predict alloy compositions that yield desired mechanical properties. The approach leverages a curated dataset of copper-based alloys and implements several generative models (i.e. CVAE, ALAE, CTGAN) to map alloy features to target properties.

- _Proof of concept._
- Dataset was modified to replace unknown character with "?"
